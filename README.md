## Simple console chess game. 
Pieces move through a multi-dimensional array. (WIP)

potential future updates:
* track moves and display history of moves
* add move restrictions on pieces
* track pieces that are taken by opponent
* build in check and checkmate scenarios
* enable playing online in real-time (node.js)
