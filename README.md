## Simple console chess game. 
*Currently uses console to display chess board and prompts to capture user inputs. Requires browser and console to run.*
**Copy and paste app.js into jsbin.com to run**

Pieces move through a multi-dimensional array. (WIP)

potential future updates:
* track moves and display history of moves
* add move restrictions on pieces
* track pieces that are taken by opponent
* build in check and checkmate scenarios
* enable playing online in real-time (node.js)
